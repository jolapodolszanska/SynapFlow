# SynapFlow

**SynapFlow** is a numerical simulation project focused on modeling neural and nerve dynamics using simplified mathematical neuron models.

The project is intended as an exploratory and educational framework that combines:
- mathematical descriptions of excitable systems,
- numerical time integration,
- interactive visualization through a desktop graphical user interface.

At its current stage, SynapFlow provides a foundation for simulating basic neuronal dynamics (e.g. reduced neuron models) and visualizing their temporal behavior. The codebase is designed to remain modular and extensible toward more complex scenarios, such as spatially extended nerve models, signal propagation, or network-level dynamics.

## Goals
- explore numerical modeling of neural activity,
- build a flexible simulation framework for experimentation,
- enable interactive parameter tuning via GUI-based tools,
- serve as a base for further academic or personal research.

## Scope
SynapFlow is **not** intended for clinical, diagnostic, or medical use.  
The focus is on qualitative behavior and numerical experimentation rather than biological realism.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Qt (PySide6)

## Status
Early development / personal research prototype.
